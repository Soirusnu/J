* Most exploits break every week. Come back to this website site often for updates and fixes.

* Use a VPN if an exploit is failing to connect to the internet for assets or updates.

* Having issues injecting your DLL(I.e. attaching exploit)? Try installing Visual Redistributable.

* DLL-only exploits require a DLL injector.
